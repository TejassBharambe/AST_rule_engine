# Real-Time Weather Monitoring and Alerting System
 This application fetches real-time weather data for selected cities, processes and stores daily summaries, and sends alerts if the temperature exceeds a user-defined threshold. The application 
 uses the OpenWeatherMap API for weather data, SQLite for data storage, and matplotlib for data visualization. Alerts are sent via email after consecutive updates indicating temperatures above 
 the threshold.
